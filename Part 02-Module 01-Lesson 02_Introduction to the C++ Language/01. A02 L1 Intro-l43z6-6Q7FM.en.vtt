00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Welcome to the first lesson of the C++ data structures and algorithms course.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.495
In this lesson, you're going to start out with

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.750
basic variables and functions and by the end of the lesson,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.339
you'll be able to read data into your C plus plus program and print it to output.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.030
We're going to start with some of the foundational types and

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.375
conditionals and loops available in C++.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.280
We'll move through these pretty quickly,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.570
but these are the core building blocks that we'll need to know in order to move on to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.820
the more advanced data structures and algorithms

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.395
that the C++ programming language provides.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.750
We'll start this lesson out with a few videos from Sebastian,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.594
where he's explaining A star search,

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:41.170
and that'll give you an idea of how the projects will work for the rest of the course.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.850
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.660
you'll be able to print to output a basic map of a maze,

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.594
and later on in the course,

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:54.515
we will build code that actually finds the solution in the path through that maze.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:56.230
Sounds great. Let's get started.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.449
Let's go.
