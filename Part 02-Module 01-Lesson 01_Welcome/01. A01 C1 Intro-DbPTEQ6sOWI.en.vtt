00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
Hello, welcome to Data Structures,

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.559
and Algorithms in C++.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.089
I'm David Silver, and I lead the School of Autonomous Systems here at Udacity.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.529
Hi, I'm Stephen Welch.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.570
I'm a Content Developer here at Udacity.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.720
In this course, you'll be starting out with basic C++,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.580
starting with variables and functions,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.949
and by the end of this course,

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.460
you will be implementing multi-file programs using object oriented programming.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.719
In particular, we'll be using a number of the containers,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.079
and algorithms provided by the C++ standard library.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.894
These are core tools that

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.065
every C++ programmer uses when they're building projects, and writing code.

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.469
The projects in this course will be very interesting.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.719
You'll be using A star algorithm to find

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.899
the shortest points or shortest path between two points on a map.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.534
In the beginning part of the course,

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.239
you'll be doing this using an ASCII map, and then by the end,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.695
you'll use OpenStreetMap, tiles,

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:56.905
and you'll find the shortest path between two points on the actual map.

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:02.030
This is such a cool project if you've ever used in Internet mapping application,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.295
and wondered how it figures out how to build a route from one on a map to another,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:09.650
you're going to be able to show that to your friends,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.530
and family, and anybody else who's interested.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.739
That sounds super awesome. Let's get started.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.439
Let's go.
