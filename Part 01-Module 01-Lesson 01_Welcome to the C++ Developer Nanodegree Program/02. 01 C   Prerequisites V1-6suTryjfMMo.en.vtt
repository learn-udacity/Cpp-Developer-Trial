1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.900
the prerequisites for this nano degree

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.819
program are that you should be an

3
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.828
intermediate level software programmer

4
00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:08.560
in any language as long as you know

5
00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.229
concepts like variables conditionals

6
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.530
loops and functions you're ready to

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.589
learn C++ we also expect that you know

8
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.079
how to execute programs ideally from the

9
00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:22.030
terminal and that you're familiar with

10
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.480
software debugging it will be helpful if

11
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.919
you're familiar with concepts like

12
00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:28.800
classes in object-oriented programming

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.038
but that's not required if you feel like

14
00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:34.689
you need to learn a little bit more

15
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.399
about software programming before

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.378
proceeding on with this nano degree

17
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.439
then I suggest either Udacity' intro

18
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.509
to programming nano degree program or

19
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.029
our intro to self-driving cars in Hana

20
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.489
degree program our intro to programming

21
00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.768
nano degree program will teach you the

22
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.439
basics of software engineering and our

23
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.268
intro to self-driving cars nano degree

24
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.549
program will teach you the basics of

25
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.399
software engineering C++ specifically

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.028
along with topics like machine learning

27
00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:08.228
physics and mathematics
