1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.409
this program is organized into four

2
00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.069
courses foundations object-oriented

3
00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.319
programming memory management and

4
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.430
concurrency

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.030
in the foundations course you'll learn

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.690
about C++ syntax and how to compile and

7
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.810
run C++ programs you'll also learn about

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.519
the input and output features of the

9
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.068
language as well as how to declare and

10
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:26.949
initialize variables structure your code

11
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.159
using conditionals and loops and

12
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.349
organize your code using functions in

13
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.948
the object-oriented programming course

14
00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.149
you'll learn how to further organize

15
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.729
your code into classes and you'll learn

16
00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.589
how to expose interfaces to those

17
00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.919
classes to other users you'll also learn

18
00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.229
how to declare certain interfaces to be

19
00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.599
public and certain to be private using

20
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.899
access modifiers you'll cover the core

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.909
concepts of object oriented programming

22
00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.419
generally including encapsulation

23
00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.849
abstraction inheritance and polymorphism

24
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.678
and you'll learn how to implement those

25
00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:04.719
features using the C++ programming

26
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.509
language you'll close this course by

27
00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.340
learning about generic programming and

28
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.278
how to use C++ templates to make your

29
00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:16.209
code more generic in the next course

30
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.918
you'll learn about memory management

31
00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.709
memory is incredibly important to the

32
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.140
C++ programming language you'll learn

33
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.238
how to pass around both references and

34
00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:27.730
pointers and you'll learn about the

35
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.590
differences between memory on the stack

36
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.649
and memory allocated from the heap

37
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.480
you'll also learn how to take advantage

38
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.878
of scope and use the resource

39
00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:39.189
acquisition is initialization paradigm

40
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.769
in order to keep track of memory that's

41
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.230
used by your program you'll close this

42
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.119
course by learning about smart pointers

43
00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.459
which are the best way to keep track of

44
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.829
pointers and dynamically allocated

45
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.028
memory in modern C++ the final course is

46
00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:58.000
concurrency in this course you'll learn

47
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.799
how to organize your code using both

48
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.679
processes and threads and you'll learn

49
00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.509
how to synchronize and communicate

50
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.480
between threads in particular you'll

51
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.279
learn about features of the C++

52
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.050
programming language that support

53
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.420
concurrent multi-threaded programming

54
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.719
including promises and futures and

55
00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.819
mutexes and locks by the time you're

56
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.219
done with all four of these courses you

57
00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.419
will be a terrific C++ developer
