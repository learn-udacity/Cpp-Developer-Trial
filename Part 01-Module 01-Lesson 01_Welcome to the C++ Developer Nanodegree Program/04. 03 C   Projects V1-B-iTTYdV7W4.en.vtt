1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.079
this nanodegree program requires you to

2
00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:04.990
complete five different projects the

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.729
first project is the route planner

4
00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.910
project in which you'll build a route

5
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.519
planner to find a route between any two

6
00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:14.919
points in a real city using data from

7
00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.400
the OpenStreetMap project the second

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.800
project is the system monitor project in

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.989
which you'll implement your own version

10
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.960
of the top program that identifies

11
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.089
variables relevant to your system and

12
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.159
prints out information about all the

13
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.539
different processes running on your

14
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.750
computer the third project is the

15
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.759
garbage collector project in which

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.518
you'll build your own version of smart

17
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.768
pointers a way to keep track of

18
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.928
dynamically allocated memory and prevent

19
00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:47.349
memory leaks the fourth project is a

20
00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.869
traffic simulation in this project

21
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.358
you'll use concurrent multi-threaded

22
00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:54.698
programming to organize traffic flow

23
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.219
through a city each vehicle will run on

24
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.649
its own thread and you'll use thread

25
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.689
synchronization in communication to help

26
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.849
the vehicles navigate intersections and

27
00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.980
help traffic flow smoothly through the

28
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.859
city the final project of this

29
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.689
nanodegree program is the capstone

30
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.659
project in this project you'll build

31
00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.689
your own C++ application using many of

32
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.250
the different skills and techniques that

33
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.629
you've learned as part of this

34
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.829
nanodegree program
