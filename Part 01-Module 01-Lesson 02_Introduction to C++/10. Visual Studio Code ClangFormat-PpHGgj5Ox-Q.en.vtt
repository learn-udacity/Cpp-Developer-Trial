00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.520
I'm in Visual Studio code and I would

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.908
like to apply clang format to my hello

3
00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:09.700
dot CPP file so I'm going to go to the

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.410
extensions and I'm going to search for

5
00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.109
clang format I'm going to install it now

6
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.669
it's installed and it says files can be

7
00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.949
formatted on demand by right-clicking in

8
00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.589
the document and selecting format

9
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.720
document or by using the Associated

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.359
keyboard shortcut usually control shift

11
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.280
F on windows control shift I on Linux

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.959
and shift command F on Mac OS so I'm on

13
00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.018
Linux so I want ctrl shift I and now if

14
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.259
I come here to hello dot CPP and I hit

15
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.279
ctrl shift I clang format actually puts

16
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.628
my one line hello world implementation

17
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.948
on the same line as my function

18
00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.378
signature and if I save this and I

19
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.029
compile it and run it everything should

20
00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.029
still work but I have clang formats

21
00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.229
default formatting style
