00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.488
Bjarne Stroustrup created c++ in 1979

2
00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.698
when he was only 29 years old he was

3
00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.470
working at Bell Labs and needed a

4
00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.000
programming language to help him

5
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.839
maintain clusters of UNIX servers he

6
00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.909
wanted a programming language with both

7
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.310
the high-level features of languages

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.109
like Simula and the raw speed of C so he

9
00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.568
created a language that he called C with

10
00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.929
classes C with classes had features like

11
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.429
classes and also strong types but

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.679
maintained the lightning-fast speed of

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.000
the C programming language C++ as he

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.640
later renamed it took off and eventually

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.500
was adopted by the international

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.899
standards organization which created an

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.538
ISO standard governing the C++

18
00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:52.779
programming language that means that C++

19
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.419
is not controlled by any one person but

20
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.788
rather by a standards body that meets

21
00:00:57.988 --> 00:01:00.070
regularly to map out the future of the

22
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.039
C++ programming language in 2011 the C++

23
00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.640
Standards Committee released C++ 11

24
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.439
which was a major update to the

25
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.259
programming language standard C++ 11

26
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.019
turned C++ into a truly modern

27
00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.988
programming language that has both the

28
00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:22.329
elegance and ease of development that we

29
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.099
associate with modern programming

30
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.528
languages while maintaining the raw

31
00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:30.519
performance that C++ has always had be

32
00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.409
honest Stroustrup remains involved in

33
00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.659
the C++ programming language to this day

34
00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.939
as a member of the ISO standards

35
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.980
committee and he'll be teaching you

36
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.509
throughout this program about the

37
00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.519
different facilities of the C++

38
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.719
programming language
