00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.458
so here we have a slightly more complex

2
00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:08.500
program this program declares a vector

3
00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.780
of strings called brothers and this is

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.169
my brother's David Ethan and Adam and

5
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.550
then we iterate over this vector and

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.659
output the name of each of the brothers

7
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.030
and if we if we run this let me make

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.100
sure I'm in the right directory G plus

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.279
plus hello dot cpp dot slash it out okay

10
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.909
so we say hello to David Ethan and Adam

11
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.409
what I would like to do now is try and

12
00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.779
debug this program just inspect what's

13
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.659
going on on each line so you might think

14
00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.579
I could come up here and and start

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.219
debugging but in fact Visual Studio code

16
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.989
is only set up out of the box to debug

17
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.299
node J ass which is not helpful for us

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.989
as C++ developers so I'm going to come

19
00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.969
to the extensions directory and search

20
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.119
for C++ and I see the microsoft c++

21
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.099
extension which is what i want to

22
00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.069
install so now i've installed that i'm

23
00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.879
gonna come back to hello dot CPP and I'm

24
00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.039
gonna try and debug again and now I'm

25
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:17.859
able to debug C++ and when I start

26
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.308
debugging I get nothing let's try coming

27
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.929
to the debug option here and select my

28
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:32.558
environment nothing happens

29
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.469
oh here in the bottom right corner I see

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.899
an error please first open a folder to

31
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.519
do advanced debug in debug configuration

32
00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.168
so I'm gonna actually have to put hello

33
00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:46.840
dot cpp in its own folder so let's open

34
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.849
a folder I'm gonna create a new folder

35
00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.359
within my temp directory called hello

36
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.168
and then I'm going to click OK now I

37
00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:59.890
have this blank folder called hello I'm

38
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.238
gonna move my hello dot CPP file which

39
00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:09.338
was in the temp directory into this temp

40
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.860
ello directory so now I see I have hello

41
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.689
dot CPP all over again

42
00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.390
let's try just compiling it and running

43
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.950
it here to make sure everything works

44
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.219
everything still works all right now

45
00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.560
let's try the bugging it and let's say

46
00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.030
we want to stop at this breakpoint

47
00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.570
that's how we set a breakpoint is as we

48
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.880
we put this red dot here next to the

49
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.800
editor on the line that we want to stop

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.090
the debugger at and we're gonna say

51
00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.450
start debugging and now I get this

52
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.610
option for all the different types of

53
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.850
debugging configurations and I'm going

54
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.900
to choose G plus plus build and debug

55
00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.790
active file actually I'm going to come

56
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.740
over here and add a configuration here g

57
00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.660
plus plus building debug active file so

58
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.240
let's say I want a debug key that out

59
00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:16.270
let's let's create a launch

60
00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:23.560
configuration let's delete this and now

61
00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:35.349
it's debug let's see oh now we have to

62
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.230
load our symbols so it's not enough to

63
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.140
just compile the file and Bill they died

64
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.210
out we need to compile the file with the

65
00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.700
debug symbols so we'll say hello dot

66
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.349
dash G and we will run on that and now

67
00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.830
you see we stopped at standard C out

68
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.230
hello brother and we can look at the

69
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.670
status of the program we have these

70
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.099
strings that are my brother's the active

71
00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.310
brother is David if we continue to the

72
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.050
next breakpoint we see the active

73
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.950
brother becomes Ethan and we can just

74
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.650
step through the code to Adam and now

75
00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.270
we're done and that's an example of how

76
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.470
to debug a program
