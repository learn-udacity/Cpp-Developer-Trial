00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.889
Here I am with Visual Studio code I've

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:04.599
just opened the editor I'm going to

3
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.030
create a new file and the first thing

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.220
I'm gonna do is save it we'll save it in

5
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:10.930
my temp directory we'll call it hello

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.999
dot CPP and I will write include

7
00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:23.190
iostream and create a main function and

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.809
I'll say standard C out hello world and

9
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.369
then I'll save that and the next thing

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.529
I'll do is I will open up a terminal

11
00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.719
down here I'll go to my temp directory

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.299
and I've already installed G plus plus

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.809
so if I check I have G plus plus so I

14
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.029
can write G plus plus hello dot CPP and

15
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.768
that should give me an e dot out file it

16
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.969
does and it prints hello world all set
