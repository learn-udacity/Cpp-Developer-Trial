00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.529
when people talk about modern C++

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.169
they're often referring to the C++ 11

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.930
release which introduced a whole range

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.669
of new features into the programming

5
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.880
language move semantics very attic

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.550

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.400
constant expression range based for

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.890
loops and smart pointers all came into

10
00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.019
the C++ programming language as part of

11
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.359
C++ 11 and change the language

12
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.858
dramatically C++ 14 was a relatively

13
00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:36.219
minor release and C++ 17 was a major

14
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.619
release although not as big as the C++

15
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.419
11 release C++ 17 includes standard file

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.099
system within the standard library

18
00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:49.959
implementations of many of the standard

19
00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.338
library algorithms in inline variables

20
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.439
C++ 20 is scheduled as a minor release

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.678
but will contain concepts which are an

22
00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:02.108
important tool for improving generic

23
00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:07.308
programming with templates in C++
